## About

`auratool` is a **work-in-progress** interactive research tool for statistically modelling distributed real-time physics simulations based on [Aura Projection].

It is currently implemented as a web app for ease of access and rapid development. Components that require increased performance will soon be implemented in *Rust* and compiled to *WebAssembly*.

## Requirements

For now, you'll only need *Node.js*. It's recommended to use something like [nvm] to acquire it.

## Usage

Visit [auratool] to access the latest deployed version.

Documentation to follow once things take shape.

## Development

In the project directory, you can run `npm start` to build, run, and test the app locally.

  * The app will start in development mode - open [http://localhost:3000] to view it in the browser.
  * The page will reload if you make changes to the sources.
  * You will also see any lint errors in the console.
